## üëã About Me

I'm **Anton Osenenko**, an Infrastructure & DevOps Engineer based in Warsaw, Poland üáµüá±.  
With 13+ years in software and 8+ years in DevOps, I build cloud-native, automated, and production-grade systems that teams actually understand and trust.

I‚Äôve worked across startups and mature platforms ‚Äî designing AWS infrastructures from scratch, migrating monoliths to Kubernetes, and building CI/CD pipelines that scale from the first commit to full production.

My focus is on **clarity, automation, and reliability** ‚Äî from Terraform modules and CDKTF setups to real-time pipelines and custom observability stacks.

In the last year, I‚Äôve been actively leveraging AI-assisted development to accelerate and refine complex builds. Drawing on my engineering experience, I‚Äôve created several end-to-end projects ‚Äî including a **commercial VPN service** (‚âà60 K lines of code, handling ~70 GB/month per user) and pixlflw.com
, an **online graphic editor** built from scratch with Vue + TypeScript (~25 K lines). These projects reflect how I use AI tools not as shortcuts, but as precision instruments to extend my reach and execution speed.
